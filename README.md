Background
----------

Computation modeling has become a crucial aspect of biological research, and [SBML](http://sbml.org) (the Systems Biology Markup Language) has become the de facto standard open format for exchanging models between software tools in systems biology.

[LibSBML](http://sbml.org/Software/libSBML) is a free, open-source programming library to help you read, write, manipulate, translate, and validate SBML files and data streams. Support for SBML Level 3 packages can be added by integrating 
the package specific code and building with the package enabled.

 SBML Level 3 is being developed as a core with additional optional packages. DEVISER facilitates the development of these packages by providing a means of creating a basic specification, UML diagrams and code for integration with libSBML.


DEVISER is written in Python and is compatible with Python 2.7 and 3.3.
